## ⚙️ How it Works

The scraper uses Marham's optimized API endpoint to fetch lab test data in the format below:

```
https://www.marham.pk/api/lab/tests-optimized?lab_id={id_parm}
https://www.marham.pk/api/lab/tests-optimized?lab_id={id_parm}&page={page_parm}
...
```
When a lab has multiple tests, the API returns data across multiple pages.


## 📦 Example API Response Structure

Data is returned in JSON format like this:

```
{
  "id": 2,
  "name": "Chughtai Lab",
  "lab_tests": [
    {
      "id": 54684,
      "lab_id": 2,
      "name": "1666 GTT / GCT (75 Grams Glucose Tolerance Test (for Pregnant Patient) (Fasting, 75gm Glucose 1 Hour, 2 Hours))",
      "type": "Pathology",
      "fee": 1500,
      "discount": 300,
      "discountPercentage": 20,
      "discountedFee": 1200
    },
    {
      "id": 54864,
      "lab_id": 2,
      "name": "17-OH Progesterone",
      "type": "Pathology",
      "fee": 4000,
      "discount": 800,

    }
  ]
}
```
